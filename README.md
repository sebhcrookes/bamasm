# bamasm
**\*deprecated\*** - this is a simple assembler written to compile my own custom assembly code into my own machine code which was interpreted by an interpreter built into BambooOS. This project is not relevant anymore as BambooOS does not use this system anymore, as I am pursuing the normal approach, with userspace code compiled as x86 binaries which are run directly on the CPU. This is an interesting project which I may continue in the future as an alternative way of running code on BambooOS, as it allows for more control over how programs execute. The disadvantage is speed - the interpreter uses up much of the CPU time.
